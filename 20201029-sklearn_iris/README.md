This is a reproducible example of my attempt to run the TFX example for local sklearn-based pipelines on the iris dataset.

To run:
 * Start an AI Notebook VM, Tensorflow 2.3
 * `./conda_env_setup.sh`
 * `./run_and_log.sh`

Full output found in `tfx_run.logfile`.

Perhaps the `tfx.dsl.io` API is in flux?
